##DECEMBER  

The project is POC for a scalable surveillance and analytics platform using Hadoop & Spark.  
Image processing is done mainly using python by converting the images to base64 format and reading as stdin input using hadoop streaming.  
Deploy a hadoop cluster using GCE click-to-deploy and run the installer.sh script in each of the nodes to test it out !
